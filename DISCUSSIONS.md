# Discussions

These are the procedures and guidelines on how the `Feature Requests` category work in the Github `Discussions`

## Feature Requests

* Any user can create a discussion in the `Feature Requests` category.
* Any user can upvote, comment, reply in the discussion item.
* Feature requests must be clear and actionable. Unclear feature requests must be clarified or they will be closed.
* Feature requests that do not receive 5 upvotes in a span of 30 days will be closed.
* Feature requests that receive 15 upvotes will be labeled as `Promoted Feature`.
* Feature requests that have more than 5 upvotes but have not reached 15 upvotes and have been stale for some time may
  be closed. This enables more visibility of new ideas as well as keeping the backlog maintainable.
* Once a `Promoted Feature` is chosen to be worked on, a final comment is put on the discussion describing the high-level
  overview of the feature. Then the discussion will be locked and it will be labeled `In Progress`.

## Feature Requests Promotion Workflow
1. A user creates a discussion in `Feature Requests`.
2. The item receives 5 votes before 30 days.
3. The item receives 15 votes and gets labeled to `Promoted Feature`.
4. The item receives attention/priority and gets labeled `In Progress` and work begins.
   The item may be labeled with a specific roadmap label.

## Github Issues vs Discussions

* Bugs - Github Issues (bug tag)
* Feature Requests - Discussions
* Small Enhancements - Github Issues (enhancement tag). Some examples:
  * Adding a model to the basic settings dropdown
  * Asking for additional documentation
  * Making a specific UI component expandable
